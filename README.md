# Professional README Generator

## Description
The purpose of this project was to create a professional readme generator using the command line. It involved using starter code with JavaScript files and the Inquirer package- and revising them to ensure that the app functions correctly. It took some time and research to find appropriate links, syntax, and methods for executing this project.

The professional README generator allows a user to generate a markdown file containing all of the elements of a professional README. When started, the application asks a series of questions for the user to answer in order to complete each section of the file. Once completed, the generated file can be copied and pasted into the user's project README.md file or utilized in any other way desired.
